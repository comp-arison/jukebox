# Jukebox

A mod for Cookie Clicker (Steam) that adds a Music Selector heavenly upgrade.

### Overview

This mod adds two heavenly upgrades to the game:

Jukebox: Unlocks the <b>Song selector</b>, letting you select the game's music.

Hot new single: Adds the album-exclusive song <b>Click Forever</b> to the track list.

### Installation

Download the latest version from the [Rleases](https://github.com/rebelderp127/jukebox/releases) and drag the "jukebox" folder (inside the downloaded zip folder) into the game's mods folder.

IMPORTANT: This mod requires CCSE. Download it [here](https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/SteamMods/CCSE.zip?v=2.031).

Install CCSE the same way you would install the Jukebox mod.

### Notes for developers

Feel free to use any part of this code for whatever you want. Credit isn't necessary, but appreciated.

I actually built this mod off of Klattmose's "[Decide Your Destiny](https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/#decide-your-destiny--steam)" mod, so there might be some code left over from that.

This mod can be a good starting point for anyone wanting to add switches, custom music, heavenly upgrades, or anything with custom icons.

Eventually I would like to make this mod independent from CCSE. If anyone wants to bother with converting the mod to non-CCSE, be my guest.

I would also like to find a way to enable achievements with this mod enabled. I heard it's impossible for any mod at the moment, but if anyone knows any workarounds, let me know.
